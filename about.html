            <p>
                Sawdust, AKA man glitter, is therapy. GIG (Guy In a Garage) Woodcraft started out of a love of sawdust therapy.
                I've been a public servant for 29 years. With public service comes stress and a need of therapy. There is no better
                therapy than mind numbing hours spent sanding wood until it shines. Most of what I've built has been kept or
                given to friends and family. It was those recipients who encouraged GIG over a number of years. Now that encouragement
                brings GIG to you as I work to bring out a retirement gig by doing what I love to give you something you will love. Be
                involved and let me know your thoughts, your likes and dislikes, your wood and wood combination suggestions. I look forward
                to hearing from you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                All the products brought to you are handmade woodcrafts from my garage. No big machines stamping out chunks of wood, 
                that would take all th fun out of it. As with all things handmade, nothing is perfect. Each piece is unique which brings
                natural beauty and slight imperfections which only adds to the uniqueness of the piece. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of what is seen here are attempts at design. Design is my weak area. Different color and wood combinations that
                I'm trying out may or may not look great to you. Your purchases will help determine what combinations and products
                work for you. Tell me your thoughts, I look forward to hearing them.
